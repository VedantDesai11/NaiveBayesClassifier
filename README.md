# Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch in python with training and testing data. The function returns the preditions, probability with which the classification was made and the error rate. The program then prints the accuracy, precision, recall and the confusion matrix. With these values on different sizes of data, we print the Receiver Operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculate the area under the curve (AUC).
